**MVC Architecture**
QuickByte follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, which organizes the codebase into three interconnected components:

Models represent the data structures, typically by interfacing with the database.
Views are what the user sees and interacts with (the user interface).
Controllers handle user input, interact with the models to process data/requests, and select views to render based on the user action and the result of the data processing.
